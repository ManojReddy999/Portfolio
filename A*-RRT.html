        <!-- Introduction -->
        <section>
          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            Motion planning is a critical challenge in robotics—especially in 3D environments laden with obstacles.
            In this project, we explore two distinct paradigms: a search-based A* algorithm and a sampling-based RRT*
            approach. Our objective is to compute collision-free, cost-optimal paths from a given start point to a goal,
            while balancing computational efficiency and path optimality. This work provides insights that are fundamental
            for autonomous navigation in real-world applications.

        <!-- Problem Formulation -->
        <section>
          <h2>Problem Formulation</h2>
          <p>
            We formalize the 3D motion planning problem as a deterministic shortest path problem in continuous space.
            The environment is modeled as a rectangular prism, and obstacles are represented as axis-aligned bounding boxes (AABBs).
            Given:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Start:</strong> [xs, ys, zs]</li>
            <li><strong>Goal:</strong> [xg, yg, zg]</li>
            <li><strong>Obstacles:</strong> AABBs defined by [xmin, ymin, zmin, xmax, ymax, zmax]</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The cost function is the path length:
          </p>
          <pre>
J(P) = ∫₀¹ ||Ṗ(t)|| dt
          </pre>

        <!-- Technical Approach: A* Algorithm -->
        <section>
          <h2>Technical Approach</h2>
          <h3>Search-Based Planning with A*</h3>
          <p>
            The first approach involves discretizing the continuous space into a grid and applying the A* algorithm.
            A* utilizes a cost function f(n) = g(n) + h(n), where g(n) is the cost from the start node to the current node,
            and h(n) is the Euclidean distance to the goal. This heuristic guides the search towards the most promising paths.
          </p>
          <pre>
Initialize open list with the start node
while open list is not empty:
    current ← node with lowest f(n)
    if current is goal:
        return path from start to goal
    for each neighbor of current:
        if neighbor is not traversable:
            continue
        tentative_g ← g(current) + cost(current, neighbor)
        if tentative_g < g(neighbor) or neighbor not in open list:
            set parent of neighbor to current
            update g(neighbor) and f(neighbor)
            add neighbor to open list if not already present
end while

          <h3>Sampling-Based Planning with RRT*</h3>
          <p>
            In parallel, we implemented a sampling-based approach using RRT*. This algorithm randomly samples the space
            and incrementally builds a tree of collision-free paths. While RRT* may produce suboptimal paths compared to A*,
            its strength lies in efficiently handling high-dimensional spaces and complex obstacle configurations.

        <!-- Implementation Details -->
        <section>
          <h2>Implementation Details</h2>
          <p>
            Our implementation was done in Python. The continuous environment is discretized into a 3D grid for A*, while
            collision checking between line segments and AABBs ensures safety. For the sampling-based method, we utilized the
            'rrt-algorithms' Python library. We tested both algorithms on various environments—including simple setups and complex
            ones like mazes, towers, and rooms—to evaluate their performance.

        <section>
          <h2>Results and Discussion</h2>
          <p>
            Our experiments reveal distinct trade-offs:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>A*:</strong> Achieves optimal paths in discretized environments. Path lengths varied from 8 to 77,
              depending on the complexity of the environment.</li>
            <li><strong>RRT*:</strong> Generally finds feasible, though sometimes suboptimal, paths with increased robustness
              in high-dimensional, cluttered settings.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Visual comparisons (see figures below) illustrate that while A* is optimal in simpler environments, RRT* can handle
            more complex spaces with irregular obstacles. The results also highlight differences in computation time and the
            number of nodes explored by each algorithm.

        <section>
          <h2>Discussion and Future Work</h2>
          <p>
            The experiments demonstrate that both algorithms have their strengths and limitations.
            A* offers optimality in structured grids, whereas RRT* provides scalability in complex environments.
            Future work could focus on hybrid methods that combine the strengths of both approaches or on enhancing the
            collision checking module to further improve planning efficiency.

        <!-- Conclusion -->
        <section>
          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>
            This project successfully compares search-based and sampling-based motion planning in continuous 3D space.
            By applying A* and RRT* to complex environments with obstacles, we provide insights into the trade-offs between path
            optimality and computational efficiency. The results lay the groundwork for more robust autonomous navigation systems.
